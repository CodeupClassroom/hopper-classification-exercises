    "**What is a Random Forest?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest is a type **Ensemble** Machine Learning algorithm called Bootstrap Aggregation or bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does it work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootstrapping** is a statistical method for estimating a quantity from a data sample, e.g. mean. You take lots of samples of your data, calculate the mean, then average all of your mean values to give you a better estimation of the true mean value. In bagging, the same approach is used for estimating entire statistical models, such as decision trees. Multiple samples of your training data are taken and models are constructed for each sample set. When you need to make a prediction for new data, each model makes a prediction and the **predictions are averaged** to give a better estimate of the true output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random forest is a tweak on this approach where decision trees are created so that rather than selecting optimal split points, suboptimal splits are made by introducing randomness.  The models created for each sample of the data are therefore more different than they otherwise would be, but still accurate in their unique and different ways. Combining their predictions results in a better estimate of the true underlying output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the example below, \"Will I exercise\", \"I\" am a single observation. Each person is an observation. The model takes each observation through the forest and votes on the most frequent class for that observation to get a final prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduction in over-fitting \n",
    "\n",
    "2. More accurate than decision trees in most cases\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Naturally performs feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Slow real time prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Difficult to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Complex algorithm so difficult to explain"
